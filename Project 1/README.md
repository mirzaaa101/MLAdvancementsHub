## Abstract
This project presents a modified version of the AdaBoosting machine learning algorithm designed to enhance classification accuracy. The traditional AdaBoosting algorithm, while effective, can benefit from improvements. Key contributions include:
- A novel model selection technique for choosing the best models from a pool.
- Modifications to AdaBoosting, including a new weighting scheme and regularization to prevent overfitting.
- Evaluation on various datasets, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements over the traditional algorithm.

## Key Features
- Improved accuracy compared to traditional AdaBoosting.
- Robustness to data noise.
- Reduced risk of overfitting.
