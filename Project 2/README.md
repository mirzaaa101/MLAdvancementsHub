**Project Date:** 17th September 2023
**Institution:** Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore

## Abstract
This research project delves into the complex world of young adults and their relationship with alcohol. It examines the significance of alcohol consumption in their daily lives, shedding light on the behaviors and experiences of "ordinary" young adult drinkers. The study covers a wide range of factors, from alcohol consumption frequency and quantity to the motivations behind their drinking habits. The aim is to unravel the intricate interplay between alcohol, peer influence, emotional well-being, and its effects on young individuals. Key findings include insights into binge drinking prevalence, the role of peer pressure, and the impact of alcohol on social interactions and emotional states. Additionally, the project assesses awareness levels of safe drinking guidelines and concerns related to the health consequences of excessive alcohol consumption. By closely observing the lives of young adults, this research aims to provide valuable insights that can inform interventions, public health strategies, and support systems tailored to the specific needs of this demographic group. Ultimately, it humanizes statistical data, offering a vivid picture of young people's experiences with alcohol.
