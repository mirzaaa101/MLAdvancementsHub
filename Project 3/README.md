# Multi-Modal Sensor Dataset for Stress Detection Among Nurses

**Abstract:** This project introduces a comprehensive multi-modal sensor dataset designed for the continuous detection of stress among nurses in a hospital setting, with a particular focus on the challenges faced during the COVID-19 outbreak. The dataset includes biometric data collected from 15 nurses, encompassing parameters such as electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate (HR), skin temperature (TEMP), and accelerometer data. In addition, a periodic smartphone-administered survey was employed to gather contextual information related to stress events.

## Dataset Overview
- **Data Sources:** The dataset combines biometric measurements with survey responses.
- **Biometric Data:** Includes EDA, HR, TEMP, and accelerometer data from 15 nurses.
- **Survey Data:** Provides contextual information about stress events.
- **Objective:** Facilitate the development and evaluation of machine learning models for stress detection among nurses.

## Key Findings
- **Ensemble Learning Models:** RandomForest and Bagging consistently achieved accuracy rates exceeding 95%.
- **Real-World Setting:** The dataset's uniqueness lies in its creation within an authentic hospital setting.
- **Research Significance:** Offers a valuable resource for researchers devoted to constructing stress detection models tailored to the nursing profession.

## Project Goals
- Enable the development of accurate and dependable stress detection models.
- Contribute to the early identification and management of stress among nurses.
- Enhance nurses' health and overall well-being in a real-world nursing environment.
